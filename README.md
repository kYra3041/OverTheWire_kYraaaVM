how i do my OverTheWire challenges

OverTheWire.org is like a playground for leveling up your Linux command skills in a super hands-on way. They’ve got these "wargames," which are basically challenges where you solve puzzles by using different Linux commands. Tldr it's about hacking into the next level by figuring out passwords hidden in files, tweaking permissions, or even decoding some funky encoded stuff.

For example, Bandit is the go-to starting point. It’s perfect if you’re just getting into the basics like ls, cat, grep, and permissions. But as you go up the levels, it gets trickier—like messing around with SSH, hex stuff, or scripting to automate tasks.
